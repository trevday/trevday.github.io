					<p><i>Mazu</i> is a narrative driven genre mash-up, featuring bullet hell and hack n' slash inspired
						fast-paced gameplay. The title is still under active development by a subset of the original
						team, and is eyeing a 2020 full release. The current work is centered around content generation,
						polish, iteration, and bug fixing. Unfortunately, I am no longer actively working on the title,
						and have not been since June of 2019. As the lead engineer on the project for nearly a year
						prior to that, however, I established many of the original systems that the game is built on.
					</p>
					<p>The list of interesting parts I wrote includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fully procedural "dungeon" generation
							<ul>
								<li>Constructed rooms and routes that felt natural but purposeful, with branching
									pathways and hidden rooms</li>
								<li>Appropriate enemy placement ensured difficulty progressed smoothly and gameplay
									flow was preserved</li>
								<li>Seamlessly merged in handmade content when configured to provide story
									progression</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Fully configurable cutscene and events system
							<ul>
								<li>Allowed story to be told in-engine, smoothly
									integrated with gameplay</li>
								<li>Enabled fast prototyping of in-game pre-scripted moments</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Configurable quest system
							<ul>
								<li>Designers could quickly write new quests with varied objective types</li>
								<li>In-game quest tracking would automatically provide player objectives based on
									current quest state</li>
								<li>Quest system integrated with events system to provide flexible tools for content
									generation</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>State based player action system, which allowed designers to tune inputs to execute
							behavior exactly as desired, important in a fast-paced action title</li>
						<li>Modular and configurable AI behavior trees, providing fast construction of diverse enemy
							characters
						</li>
						<li>Efficient "save anywhere" system, which supported fully dynamic save points while
							serializing only a small amount of data</li>
					</ul>

					<p><i>Node: Gravity Waves</i> started life as a Global Game Jam project in 2017. After the
						successful
						jam,
						however, a subset of the original group felt strongly about the core concept and continued
						development
						with the goal of releasing on mobile app stores. I spearheaded this second phase, acting as lead
						producer and engineer. After adding new content, polishing features, and ironing out bugs,
						<i>Node:
							Gravity Waves</i> was released on the iOS App Store. After release, lack of ongoing support
						and
						updates for the title unfortunately means that it has since been removed from distribution on
						the

						App Store. But it is still available to play via browser on <a

				<p>The idea with this project was to implement a version of
					flow field pathfinding as described in <a
						href="http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter23_Crowd_Pathfinding_and_Steering_Using_Flow_Field_Tiles.pdf"
						target="_blank">this paper</a>. Java with Processing was possibly not the best choice for
					performance, but it offers a simple library for visual output and I wanted to prototype
					quickly without worrying about those details. I believe this flow field implementation is pretty
					successful, and the
					"extra features" such as formations work well, but individual unit steering does leave something to
					be
					desired.
					That, however, was not the focus of the project, and is really here to aid in providing a visual
					demonstration of the algorithm.</p>
				<h5>Some Quick Features:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Flow field pathfinding which subdivides the map into "sectors" of a configurable size
						<ul>
							<li>A per sector flow field cache that is shared amongst all units, which means units
								navigating
								in a similar manner through a given sector can use the same calculated flow field</li>
							<li>A* search to chain sectors for unit navigation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Navigation optimizes for differences in terrain "height", or difficulty of moving through that
						terrain
						<ul>
							<li>Also supports navigating around impassable obstacles</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						A formation system that allows grouping arbitrary numbers of units together with a specified
						separation pattern
						<ul>
							<li>
								The formation system is very modular, and adding new formations requires a single new
								function
							</li>
							<li>
								Formations are dynamic and will reform correctly if units are added or removed
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Units have a very simple collision avoidance behavior that sends out a single raycast and
						applies an
						avoidance force if the unit will collide with something
					</li>

				<p class="thick-border-bottom border-secondary"><strong>The Sunrise Engine project is effectively dead
						and I
						am no longer actively developing it nor
						planning to continue with it. The pieces that are done consist of core systems (math library,
						components, runtime loop, scripting) and a basic rendering engine (rough shader pipeline, rough
						lighting support, texture support), but I don't believe it is complete enough to warrant posting
						the code. This was still a valuable learning experience for me, as it was one of the first
						engines I tried to build. I have ambitions to start another large-scale engine project at some
						point, this
						time utilizing what I have learned since attempting Sunrise to craft a more unique and focused
						design.</strong></p>
				<p>Sunrise Engine is my latest project, and my first attempt at building a game engine (and hopefully a
					game,
					eventually) entirely "from scratch". By "from scratch", I mean that I am writing the guts of all the
					systems
					in C++, without using any pre-existing game focused libraries or assists. So far I have the entire
					framework
					outlined and mostly written, along with most of the main gameplay loop systems, and the backbone of
					the
					rendering portion of the engine. As can be seen from the image above, model loading and basic
					lighting
					are
					in place. My next goal is to implement proper physics for collisions, and then from there to try and
					build a
					prototype game.</p>
				<p>The overarching design of the engine, which revolves around a flexible system where game objects are
					essentially containers for components, takes heavy inspiration from Unity, a popular engine that I
					particularly enjoy using. I've always wanted to better understand how the pieces I am using worked
					under
					the
					hood, and since Unity isn't open source, I suppose this is my attempt to do so, by doing it myself.
				</p>
				<p>Although I am trying to write as much as I can myself, there are a few useful libraries and tools I
					am
					using
					so far: OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW, Assimp, and DevIL.</p>
				<p>The model displayed was not created by me, it can be found <a

					<p>The game places the player as a space pirate attacking convoys of enemies. The player collects

						by me
						in C#. The models were taken from <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/"
							target="_blank">Turbosquid</a>.</p>
					<p>The game features multiple different enemy AI types, including:</p>

						<li>An enemy who will shoot at the player from a certain distance</li>

						a combat mode, where they will follow whatever their specified combat actions should be.</p>
					<p>The other major feature of the game is a fully fleshed out inventory system. The player can
						collect
						weapons,
						armor, and shields, and equip and destroy these components as needed. Different equipment also
						has
						different
						effects. Weapons may offer varying functionality or faster fire rates, for example.
